<!-- Inline elements are those elements which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of element. On the other hand, block-level elements take up the entire space of its parent element. Let us understand this with an example-

If we write any text in the paragraph tag like this-

<p>This is a paragraph</p>

<p>This is also a paragraph</p>
OR

<p>This is a paragraph</p> <p>This is also a paragraph</p>

The Block element means that it will take the full width of a single line and does not allow any other content to fit in it. But, if we write both the texts between the <span> tags like-

    <span>This is a paragraph</span> <span>This is also a paragraph</span>
    Then we see that both the texts will appear in the same line. It is because the <span> tag is an inline element. It allows all the elements in the same line.
    
    To understand it more, we can take the help of CSS by applying the border. However, you need not worry about the border as it is a part of CSS. I’m using this just for the case of an example. 
    
    <p style= “border: 2px solid, red;”>This is a paragraph</p> <p style= “border: 2ox solid blue;”>This is also a paragraph</p>

    <span style= “border: 2px solid red;”>This is a span</span> <span style = “border: 2px solid red;”>This is also a span</span> -->
