    The ID is an identifier which must be unique in the whole HTML document. It is used to find an element while linking, scripting, or styling. Whereas, Classes allow CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements. Let us start by making a new file as tut10.html and adding an instant boilerplate to get the basic HTML template. Name the <title> tag as Ids and Classes in HTML to give the title of the website. 

Here, I'll try to explain with the vert basic example. When a new child is born, we urge to give him a name or his identity by which he will be known further. Or if you are having a pet, you must have given him some name to call. In the same way, IDs refer to giving a name to any particular element for its identity. It simply refers giving an identity to an element. We know, no two names can be given to any of the two members of the family. In the same way, one ID can be given to only one element on a website. Therefore, in the below example, the id mainBox cannot be given to any other element.

<div id= “mainBox” class= “redBG”>

    <span class="redBg"></span>
    <!-- Select and press ctrl + / to comment -->
    <!-- Emmet -->
    <!-- . is for class and # is for id -->
    <span class="redBg"></span>
    <span id="mainSpan"></span>
    <div class="redBg blackBorder anotherClass"></div>

    <!-- Emmet takes div tag as default -->
    <div class="blackBackground"></div>

    <!-- Creating multiple elements using Emmet -->
    <!-- span.myClass.myClass2.myClass3*4 + <Tab> to print 4 similar elements using Emmet -->
    <span class="myClass myClass2 myClass3">First</span>
    <span class="myClass myClass2 myClass3">Second</span>
    <span class="myClass myClass2 myClass3">Third</span>
    <span class="myClass myClass2 myClass3">Fourth</span>
