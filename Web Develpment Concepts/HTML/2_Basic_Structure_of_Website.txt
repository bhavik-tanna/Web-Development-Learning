<!-- Basic Structure of a Website -->

<!--

    The HTML code contains some sections such as DOCTYPE, meta tags, head, and body. All the tags that we include in an HTML file, needs to be first opened and then closed by angular brackets. 
    Let us now understand different sections one by one.

-> Doctype HTML
   Doctype HTML justifies that it is a HTML document. So, we are defining specifically for a browser to understand that it is an HTML document. 
   To understand more about the type of documents, you can visit here.

-> <html lang= “en”>
   It is the opening part of the HTML tag that tells us the language of the document is in English.

-> <head>
    Head contains all the meta-tags in it which is used to describe the contents of a website. 
    Meta means providing information about information. Therefore, meta tags are used to define the keywords and descriptions on our website. 
    Head also contains the title of the website and all the external files like CSS and JavaScript that we link to it.

-> <body> 
    Body contains all the contents of the webpage in it. However, in the beginning, our website may look a little uglier but after including stylesheets it will start looking attractive. 


_> Sometimes we want to write a particular thing that we do not want the browser to take it as a part of code. 
   So, we can include it in the comments by writing "<!-- Your text -->" <!-- in this format. However, there is a shortcut to convert any text into comments. 
   You need to press “Ctrl + / (forward slash)” to convert any texts into comments. 
   Comments are completely ignored by the browser and are treated as those parts in the code which the developer writes for his understanding. 
   It is necessary because from time to time our codes will get lengthier and we do not want to mix everything. Therefore, comments become important for reference to anything in the future. -->
